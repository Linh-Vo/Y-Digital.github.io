- title: Practice what you preach
  text: 'For an electric infrastructure company we have analyzed large amounts of data, dating back to the 1980s. Useful and important information about infrastructure dating back to that decade, but unfindable in todayâ€™s operation because data were not configured to be found with the current technology of the operations of today. By using the Ally-platform of Y.digital, the information can now be easily accessed for employees, without having to follow complicated and knowledge-intensive work instructions for finding and archiving documents.
  
  Y.digital is all about empowering humans with the latest AI-technology.'
