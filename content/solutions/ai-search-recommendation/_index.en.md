- title: Searching & finding
  text: Searching and finding documents has changed immensely over last 2 decades, with the arrival of search engines on the internet searching for information has become more accessible. Yet, when searching internally within organization for information the possibility to finding what you are looking for is often less successful. The difference is that within most organizations use, specific jargon and the amount of expert knowledge that is needed to successfully find documents is elevated.

- title: Call Handling
  text: Call Handling offers clients the ability to self-service, giving them the
    opportunity to solve problems on-demand; also outside office hours. By starting
    the conversation with the open question ‘How can I help you?’, clients can converse
    with Ally in a natural way. Call Handling thus reduces call volume and allows
    agents in contact centres to stop spending time on simple, repetitive questions.
    They can focus on more complex issues.

- title: Registration
  text: The conversation registration feature summarizes a transcript of an ongoing
    discussion using an AI natural language model and in co-creation with the agent
    registers all information in your CRM system. Hereby, Ally determines the issue
    description and the resolution. Real-time summarisation solves the issue where
    a customer needs to repeat their query and other information when transferred
    from a voice assistant to an agent.

- title: Agent Assist
  text: 'When Ally is ‘listening in’ on the call and summarising in real time, it
    can also suggest possible answers to the agent; even linking back to relevant
    parts of an instruction manual or knowledge base in your backend. Customers and
    human agents both benefit from this ''whisper'' feature. For new employees, this
    reduces the need to learn lengthy company handbooks by heart – or frantically
    searching for the correct information while on the call. The consumer receives
    prompt, precise responses to their queries. '
