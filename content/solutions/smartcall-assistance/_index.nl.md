- title: Customer Identification
  text: Customer identification is the process of verifying the identity of persons
    and checking the authorisation via the phone channel in order to prepare the human
    agent for further interaction with the customer or authorize the customer for
    self-service. Ally can verify a caller's identity through your CRM system using
    their phone number and personal details such as date of birth, postal code, etc.
    Once the identity and intent of the caller are clear, the assistant can proceed
    to either fulfil or route the call.

- title: Call Handling
  text: Call Handling offers clients the ability to self-service, giving them the
    opportunity to solve problems on-demand; also outside office hours. By starting
    the conversation with the open question ‘How can I help you?’, clients can converse
    with Ally in a natural way. Call Handling thus reduces call volume and allows
    agents in contact centres to stop spending time on simple, repetitive questions,
    and focus on more complex issues.

- title: Call Routing
  text: Based on the customer’s input, Ally connects the customer to the best agent
    for their unique issue. This can be based on variables such as waiting times,
    a preference to talk to the same person they previously spoke to, or specific
    subject matter knowledge of the agent. No matter who the call is routed to, Ally
    is the ideal colleague and will always hand over the call with all information
    ready to go.

- title: Registration
  text: The conversation registration feature summarizes a transcript of an ongoing
    discussion using an AI natural language model and registers all information in
    your CRM system. Hereby, Ally determines the issue description and all resolutions
    tried that have been performed previously. Real-time summarisation solves the
    issue where a customer needs to repeat their query and other information when
    transferred from a voice assistant to an agent.

- title: Agent Assist
  text: When Smart Call Assistance is ‘listening in’ on the call and summarising in
    real-time, it can also suggest possible answers to the agent; even linking back
    to relevant parts of an instruction manual. Customers and human agents both benefit
    from whisper agents. For new employees, this reduces the need to learn lengthy
    company handbooks by heart – or frantically searching for the correct information
    while on the call. The consumer receives prompt, precise responses to their queries.
