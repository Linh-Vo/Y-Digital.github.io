    ## The Role

    Our Digital Transformation Consultants work directly with high-profile organisations across different sectors (government, financial, utilities, health). You represent Y.

You make our AI solutions tangible and understandable by giving presentations, inspiration sessions and facilitating design labs, to generate and prioritise valuable ideas, create roadmaps and develop prototypes in close cooperation with customers. You turn ideas into concrete projects, elaborating feasibility studies, business process designs, conversation designs, information and knowledge models. You lead the digital transformation project during design, development and implementation of the AI solution, using our agile approach, working in multi-disciplinary teams. You will work closely with our highly-skilled AI experts: a strong peer group of experienced machine learning engineers and data scientists. Within this role, as we are expanding and growing rapidly, there is ample room to develop, grow and achieve your personal goals and ambitions.
