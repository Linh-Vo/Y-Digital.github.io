We take immense pride in our dedicated Y.digital team, who work diligently every day to craft high-quality AI solutions for our clients.

“I'm really proud that Y.digital has been recognised as one of the fastest growing companies in The Netherlands as one of the recipients of this year's FD Gazelle awards. Besides being a fantastic achievement by the team this is a testament to the fact that A.I. has now entered the public consciousness as an indispensible tool for Human Empowerment. I'm confident we'll be strong contenders for the FD Gazelle for many years to come!” - CTO & Managing Director Ian FitzPatrick.
