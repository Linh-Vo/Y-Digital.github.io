An interesting article in Financiele Dagblad last week on the use of advanced text analytics on a large set of news articles. The DNB did an analysis on c. 1 million articles spanning 36 years.

### Predictive power from news articles

The study by the DNB was aimed at various events and patterns that could be found leading up to these events from other news items. Although in retrospect this is relatively easy, the matching patterns are striking and illustrate the value of gathering intelligence using NLP (Natural Language Processing). The challenge is in developing predictive models for finding patterns and predicting outcomes that can be used for decision making in all sorts of tactical situations.

Having built Market Monitors, Competitive Intel Radars and ESG Radars since 2012 the outcome of this DNB study was no surprise. Do you want to know more about the value we could create for you? Visit [www.y.digital](http://www.y.digital/).
