An oft-quoted statistic is that, shockingly, only [1 in 10 Data Science projects](https://venturebeat.com/2019/07/19/why-do-87-of-data-science-projects-never-make-it-into-production/ "https://venturebeat.com/2019/07/19/why-do-87-of-data-science-projects-never-make-it-into-production/") ever make it to production. One unfortunate, high-profile example is the winner of the [Netflix prize](https://www.wired.com/2012/04/netflix-prize-costs/ "https://www.wired.com/2012/04/netflix-prize-costs/") which had the potential to boost recommendation accuracy by 10 percent (not insignificant at the scale of Netflix' services), but was sadly never adopted. And while, in the meantime, the field certainly hasn't been stagnant and some terrain has been gained, it's fair to say that Data Science is still not realising its full potential. It would, of course, be an oversimplification to single out one factor as the cause (major culprits  
being silo'd data and often equally silo'd organisational structures), but while 2012 saw Data Science being heralded as the [sexiest job of the 21st century](https://hbr.org/2012/10/data-scientist-the-sexiest-job-of-the-21st-century "https://hbr.org/2012/10/data-scientist-the-sexiest-job-of-the-21st-century") it is perhaps telling that recently another role as emerged as [best job in the US](https://www.forbes.com/sites/louiscolumbus/2019/03/17/machine-learning-engineer-is-the-best-job-in-the-u-s-according-to-indeed/?sh=14324857bb0a "https://www.forbes.com/sites/louiscolumbus/2019/03/17/machine-learning-engineer-is-the-best-job-in-the-u-s-according-to-indeed/?sh=14324857bb0a"), namely, the Machine Learning (ML) Engineer.
