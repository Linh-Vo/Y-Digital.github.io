An oft-quoted statistic is that, shockingly, only [1 in 10 Data Science projects](https://venturebeat.com/2019/07/19/why-do-87-of-data-science-projects-never-make-it-into-production/ "https://venturebeat.com/2019/07/19/why-do-87-of-data-science-projects-never-make-it-into-production/") ever make it to production. One unfortunate, high-profile example is the winner of the [Netflix prize](https://www.wired.com/2012/04/netflix-prize-costs/ "https://www.wired.com/2012/04/netflix-prize-costs/") which had the potential to boost recommendation accuracy by 10 percent (not insignificant at the scale of Netflix' services), but was sadly never adopted. And while, in the meantime, the field certainly hasn't been stagnant and some terrain has been gained, it's fair to say that Data Science is still not realising its full potential. It would, of course, be an oversimplification to single out one factor as the cause (major culprits being silo'd data and often equally silo'd organisational structures), but while 2012 saw Data Science being heralded as the [sexiest job of the 21st century](https://hbr.org/2012/10/data-scientist-the-sexiest-job-of-the-21st-century "https://hbr.org/2012/10/data-scientist-the-sexiest-job-of-the-21st-century") it is perhaps telling that recently another role as emerged as [best job in the US](https://www.forbes.com/sites/louiscolumbus/2019/03/17/machine-learning-engineer-is-the-best-job-in-the-u-s-according-to-indeed/?sh=14324857bb0a "https://www.forbes.com/sites/louiscolumbus/2019/03/17/machine-learning-engineer-is-the-best-job-in-the-u-s-according-to-indeed/?sh=14324857bb0a"), namely, the Machine Learning (ML) Engineer.

To understand why Machine Learning Engineering arose as a discipline it's worth examining one of the other barriers that ML models have encountered on the road to production. Many academically trained Data Scientists are reluctant to venture outside of their jupyter-notebook centric comfort zones. Unfortunately, Jupyter notebooks — however useful for exploration analysis, and prototyping — have proven notoriously difficult to put into  
production (though some products and services have made valiant attempts). It's also worth noting that few ML models operate completely in isolation. For AI systems to deliver their value, they need to evolve from model to solution.
